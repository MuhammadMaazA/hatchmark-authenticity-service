Hatchmark is a platform designed to solve the modern problem of digital trust. It provides a way to prove the origin and authenticity of creative works by creating a precise, immutable "hatch mark" on a verifiable digital ledger.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal is to build a robust, end-to-end system where a creator can upload their original work to:
1.  **Create an Immutable Record:** Generate a unique digital fingerprint of the file and record it on the **Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)**, providing a tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable timestamp of creation.
2.  **Embed an Invisible Watermark:** Process the file using a containerized application on **AWS Fargate** to embed a robust, invisible watermark containing its authenticity credentials.

This allows anyone to later verify a piece of content against the ledger to confirm its origin and integrity.
