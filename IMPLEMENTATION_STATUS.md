  - `POST /verify` - Verify asset authenticity by hash or object key
  - `GET /ledger` - Retrieve all asset records
  - `POST /ledger` - Add new asset to ledger
  - `POST /process` - Process assets for watermarking

#### Core Infrastructure (AWS)
- **S3 Buckets**: 
  - `hatchmark-ingestion-bucket-36933227` (for original files)
  - `hatchmark-processed-bucket-36933227` (for watermarked files)
- **DynamoDB Table**: `hatchmark-assets` (immutable asset registry, replacing QLDB)
- **AWS Profile**: `hatchmark-dev` configured

#### Watermarker Service
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Features**:
  - Invisible watermarking using LSB steganography
  - Perceptual hash computation with imagehash
  - AWS S3 integration for file processing
  - DynamoDB integration for asset tracking
  - Standalone and SQS-polling modes

#### AWS SAM Infrastructure
- **Template**: Complete CloudFormation template
- **Resources**:
  - Lambda functions for all operations
  - API Gateway HTTP API
  - Step Functions workflow
  - IAM roles with least-privilege access
  - SQS queues for async processing
  - ECS/Fargate configuration for watermarker

### Usage Instructions

#### Start Local Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend && python local_dev_server.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Access at: http://localhost:8080
```

#### Test System
```bash
python simple_test.py  # Quick API test
python system_test.py  # Comprehensive test
```

#### Deploy to AWS
```bash
./deploy.sh  # Complete deployment script
```

### API Examples

#### Upload File
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/uploads/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "my-image.jpg"}'
```

#### Verify Asset
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hash": "abc123def456"}'
```

#### Check Ledger
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/ledger
```
