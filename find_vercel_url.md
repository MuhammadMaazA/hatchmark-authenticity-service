# How to Find Your Vercel Deployment URL

## Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Find your hatchmark project in the dashboard
3. Click on it - you'll see the URL prominently displayed
4. It will look like: `https://hatchmark-frontend-xyz.vercel.app` or `https://your-custom-domain.com`

## Method 2: Git Repository
If you connected your GitHub repo to Vercel:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Look for the "Environments" section or deployment badges
3. Vercel deployments are usually shown there

## Method 3: Vercel CLI (if installed)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# List your projects and deployments
vercel ls

# Get project info
vercel inspect your-project-url
```

## Method 4: Check Your Browser History
If you've visited your deployed site before, check your browser history for URLs containing:
- `vercel.app`
- Your custom domain (if you set one up)

## Method 5: Email Notifications
Check your email for Vercel deployment notifications - they contain the deployment URLs.

Once you have your Vercel URL, I can run the tests for you!
